    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, using the data developed in the EDA-19 notebook, two studies will be completed: \n",
    "- Locus\n",
    "- Strand.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two study names appear frequently in the variables in the code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strand\n",
    "\n",
    "This particular variable explains whether or not the sequences associated with Chromosome 19 are a protein. If the value is positive, then the sequence can make a protein. If the value is negative, then the sequence doesn't make a protein. Another way to think of this value is that a positive value means that particular length of DNA codes for something useful, and a negative value might constitute junk DNA. Currently, proteins are isolated first, then sequenced, and then that sequence is matched against a known genome. If this study produces predictive capabilities, then it is possible that in the instance of novel DNA, or RNA, that protein material can be predicted based on the amino acid composition dictated by the DNA, without first having to isolate the proteins separately. This would save a substantial amount of time and funding in the genomic world.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Locus\n",
    "\n",
    "This particular variable explains the location on Chromosome 19 where the associated genetic information for each variable is stored. When our body chooses to copy the genic blueprint to make a protein, this location is where that happens. If this study produces predictive capabilities, then it might be possible to target specific locations in a genetic code using amino acid content. This could replace the current necessity to radio-actively tag portions of genetic material for study. Additonally, the applications of this type of labeling system in the medical and research spheres are endless, to name a few: drug targeting, medicine development, individualizing medicine delievery, identifying disease."
